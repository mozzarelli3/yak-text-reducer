# SoC Final Project with YakChat

## Project Overview
YakChat users face limitations when sending SMS messages due to the 160-character per segment restriction. This constraint often prevents users from expressing their thoughts fully and succinctly. The goal of this project is to develop a ReactJS application that helps users automatically shorten and summarize their text messages without losing the core message. By integrating advanced text summarization techniques, the app will enable users to convey their messages effectively within the character limit.
 
## Objectives
- Develop a user-friendly ReactJS application that can be used alongside YakChatâ€™s application.
- Implement text summarization functionality to shorten users' input messages to fit within the 160-character limit or 320-character limit (the user should be able to choose the limit).
- Ensure the summarized text retains the original message's intent and meaning.
- Provide a real-time preview of the shortened message before sending.
- Enhance user satisfaction by reducing the effort required to manually edit messages.
 
## Scope
### In Scope:
- Design and development of the front-end application using ReactJS.
- Integration of text summarization algorithms or APIs.
- User interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design focused on simplicity and ease of use.
- Testing for functionality, usability, and performance within the 3-week timeframe.
- Deployment of the app for user acceptance testing.


### Out of Scope:
- Back-end development beyond necessary API integrations.
- Long-term maintenance and support post-deployment.
- Development of a native mobile application (the project focuses on a web-based ReactJS app).
 
## Deliverables
- Wireframes and UI/UX designs finalized.
- Selection and testing of text summarization methods (e.g., third-party APIs or custom algorithms).
- Development of the ReactJS application core features.
- Integration of text summarization functionality.
- Internal testing and iteration based on feedback.
- Finalize development and fix any critical bugs.
- Quality assurance testing completed.
- Deployment of the application for user acceptance testing.
 
### Technical Resources available:
- Development environment setup (IDE like VSCode, version control systems like Git).
- Access to text summarization APIs (e.g., Azure OpenAI GPT APIs, Hugging Face models)
- Testing tools and frameworks (e.g., ViTest for ReactJS).
